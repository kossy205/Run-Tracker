# Run Tracker
An MVVM android app that tracks runs in real-time on a map, drawing run route with a polyline. It calculates speed, distance, and calories burned, all in realtime. After each run, it saves the route as a bitmap and displays your data in a recycler view which was implemented with DiffUtil.

## Built using the following tech stack:

- Kotlin for Android.

- Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous operations.

- Room Database for offline storage of run history.

- ViewBinding which also improves the apps performance and made interactions with UI safer.


## Features

- Realtime speed, distance, calories burnt calculator.
- See your run route in realtime.
- Kepp  Track of all Run history.
- Sort history by date, calories burnt, speed etc.
